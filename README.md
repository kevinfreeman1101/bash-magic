# BASH-MAGIC

Use the included .bashrc file to gain a number of aliases intended to reduce the characters typed when working from the command line.

## Development Status
Infancy

This repo is in early development, but should work  on most Linux systems. For now, you'll need to swap out your directory names, but I hope to add a configuration script soon to help with this.

I'm using an Ubuntu 18.04 variant that didn't have a ~/.bash_aliases file. If you also don't yet have one, just copy `.bash_aliases` from this repo into your home directory; otherwise, append that file's contents to your existing `.bash_aliases`. 

Coming soon: scripts, tutorials, expansions to .bash_aliases  file and documentation all-around!
