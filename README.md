# BASH-MAGIC

Use the included .bashrc file to gain a number of aliases intended to reduce the characters typed when working from the command line.

## Development Status
level 0, "Can I play, Daddy?"

I.E., this repo is in early development, but should work beautifully on most Linux systems. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04, which doesn't include a ~/.bash_aliases file, so I had to create one in my home directory (~) and reload bash with `source ~/.bashrc` to refresh my shell and make the commands available.

Coming soon: scripts, tutorials, expansions to .bash_aliases  file and documentation all-around!

Next level: Level 1, "Don't hurt me."
